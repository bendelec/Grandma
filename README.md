OMA-DM 2.0 client library in C++



## Build Dependencies:
OpenSSL (e.g. sudo apt install libssl-dev)
NLohann JSON (e.g. sudo apt install nlohmann-json3-dev)
YHirose httplib (e.g. sudo apt install libcpp-httplib-dev)
tinyxml2 (e.g. sudo apt install libtinyxml2-dev)

Ubuntu packages of httplib and tinyxml2 seem to be missing cmake files. It is recommended to install those from upstream instead.
